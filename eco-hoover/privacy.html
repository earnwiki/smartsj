                    <p class="">Due to challenges related to Covid-19, receipt of your order may take a little longer than normal. Kindly trust and be patient as all essential employees (at our warehouse, UPS, USPS and FedEx) are working hard and doing their best to get packages to our customers during these difficult times! Your order will be delivered, but may be delivered later due to local and global restrictions by postal carriers.</p>
                    <p class="">Due to these delays we have experienced an overwhelming amount of calls, emails and chats and kindly ask for your patience and trust your order will be delivered. Once your order has been shipped you will receive an email with all your tracking information.</p>
