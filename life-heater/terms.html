                        <p class="">We do not guarantee, represent or warrant that your use of our service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure or error-free. We do not warrant that the results that may be obtained from the use of the service will be accurate or reliable. You agree that from time to time we may remove the service for indefinite periods of time or cancel the service at any time, without notice to you.

                        <p class="pt-2 lead font-weight-bold">SECTION 14 - DISPUTE RESOLUTION</p>
                        <p class="">In the event that there is a dispute, claim or controversy between you and us, or between you and any third-party service provider or application provider acting on our behalf, and which dispute, claim or controversy arises out of or relates to federal or state statutory claims, common law claims, these Terms, our Privacy Policy, or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof, including the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, such dispute, claim or controversy will be determined by arbitration in Miami, Florida before one arbitrator. The arbitration will be administered by JAMS. For claims greater than $250,000, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures in effect at the time the arbitration is commenced will apply. For claims less than or equal to $250,000, the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is commenced will apply. The arbitrator will apply the substantive law of the State of Florida, exclusive of its conflict or choice of law rules. Nothing in this paragraph will preclude the parties from seeking provisional remedies in aid of arbitration from a court of appropriate jurisdiction. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the provision in this paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16) will govern any arbitration conducted pursuant to these Terms. Either party may commence arbitration by providing to JAMS and the other party to the dispute a written demand for arbitration, setting forth the subject of the dispute and the relief requested (“Arbitration Demand”).</p>

                        <p class="">To the fullest extent permitted by law, each of the parties agrees that any proceeding, whether in arbitration or in court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, each party knowingly and irrevocably waives any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.</p>
                        <p class="">The appointed arbitrator may award monetary damages and any other remedies allowed by the state law designated above. In making his or her determination, the arbitrator will not have the authority to modify any term or provision of these Terms. The arbitrator will deliver a reasoned written decision with respect to the dispute (the “Award”) to each party, who will promptly act in accordance the Award. Any Award (including interim or final remedies) may be confirmed or enforced in any court having jurisdiction, including any court having jurisdiction over either party or its assets. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding on the parties, and will not be subject to appeal or review. Each party will advance one-half of the fees and expenses of the arbitrator, the costs of the attendance of the court reporter at the arbitration hearing, and the costs of the arbitration facility. In any arbitration arising out of or related to these Terms, the arbitrators will award to the prevailing party, if any, costs and attorneys’ fees reasonably incurred by the prevailing party in connection with that aspect of its claims or defenses on which it prevails, and any opposing awards of costs and attorneys’ fees awards will be offset. The parties will maintain the confidential nature of the arbitration proceeding, the hearing and the Award, except as may be necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration hearing on the merits, or except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, or confirmation of an Award or its enforcement, or unless otherwise required by any applicable law. Any documentary or other evidence produced in any arbitration hereunder will be treated as confidential by the parties, witnesses and arbitrators, and will not be disclosed to any third person (other than witnesses or experts), except as required by any applicable law or except if such evidence was obtained from the public domain or is otherwise obtained independently of the arbitration.</p>

                        <p class="pt-2 lead font-weight-bold">SECTION 15 - INDEMNIFICATION</p>
                        <p class="">You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless <strong>Black Box Products</strong> and our parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, partners, officers, directors, agents, contractors, licensors, service providers, subcontractors, suppliers, interns and employees, harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, including attorneys’ fees incurred from counsel selected by us in our sole discretion, made by any third-party due to or arising out of your breach of these Terms of Service or the documents they incorporate by reference, or your violation of any law or the rights of a third-party.</p>

                        <p class="pt-2 lead font-weight-bold">SECTION 16 - SEVERABILITY</p>
                        <p class="">In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of Service, such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.</p>

                        <p class="pt-2 lead font-weight-bold">SECTION 17 - TERMINATION</p>
                        <p class="">The obligations and liabilities of the parties incurred prior to the termination date shall survive the termination of this agreement for all purposes.

                        <p class="pt-2 lead font-weight-bold">SECTION 19 - GOVERNING LAW</p>
                        <p class="">These Terms of Service and any separate agreements whereby we provide you Services shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Florida.</p>

                        <p class="pt-2 lead font-weight-bold">COVID-19</p>
                        <p class="">Due to challenges related to Covid-19, receipt of your order may take a little longer than normal. Kindly trust and be patient as all essential employees (at our warehouse, UPS, USPS and FedEx) are working hard and doing their best to get packages to our customers during these difficult times! Your order will be delivered, but may be delivered later due to local and global restrictions by postal carriers.</p>
                        <p class="">Due to these delays we have experienced an overwhelming amount of calls, emails and chats and kindly ask for your patience and trust your order will be delivered. Once your order has been shipped you will receive an email with all your tracking information.</p>
